**As a** developer 
**I need** to set up a local development environment  
**So that**  I can develop, test, and run the microservice efficiently  
      
### Details and Assumptions
    * The environment should include Flask, the necessary database, and dependencies. 
    * A clear README file will document setup instructions.     

### Acceptance Criteria     
    
    Given a new development machine  
    When I follow the setup instructions 
    Then I should have a fully functional development environment
